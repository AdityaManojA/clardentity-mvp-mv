"""The parts of answering that the app and the landing demo share.

They used to answer through different code, and the demo came out as a
different product - no gist, no verdict box, no claim checking. The answer
is one pipeline now (services/answer_pipeline); what is pinned here is the
pure part of it that decides things: which pre-answer question stops a turn,
and which model writes the answer.
