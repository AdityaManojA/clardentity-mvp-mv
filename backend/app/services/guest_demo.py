"""The allowance behind the landing page's try-it-here box.

Someone who has not signed up can hold a short conversation on the stage,
and is asked to sign up once it has cost 5,000 tokens. Everything here is
about making that affordable rather than about being precise: nothing bills
off these counters, and losing them costs at most one extra free
conversation.

Two counters, not one, because they stop different things.

The per-session budget is the product rule: one visitor, one taste of it.
The session id comes from the browser, so it is trivially rotated - clearing
storage or opening a private window buys another 5,000 - and that is fine,
because the point is a demo rather than a paywall.

The per-address budget is the cost rule, and it is the one that matters. It
is what stops a script from rotating session ids in a loop and spending the
answer budget for the month in an afternoon. It is deliberately much larger
than one session, so a household, an office or a university behind one
address can all try it, and deliberately finite.

Both expire. A counter that never resets turns a demo into a one-time offer
for anyone whose address is shared.
