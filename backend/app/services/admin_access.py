"""Who counts as an administrator, and how the first one comes to exist.

The admin view lists every account's email address and what each has spent,
so "any signed-in user" - which is all the existing /admin/settings endpoints
require - is not a sufficient gate for it. Membership is an explicit list of
addresses in configuration, not a column anyone can set through the app: a
privilege that can be granted from inside the product is a privilege an
attacker can grant themselves.
