"""Writing an answer and then checking it - the part every chat surface shares.

There are two ways to ask Clardentity something: the app, signed in, and the
try-it-here demo on the landing page. They used to answer through different
code. The demo was a deliberately small thing - the fast model, the mode's
instructions, and the text streamed back - and so a visitor asking
Decision-making got prose with no verdict box and no gist card, and a
visitor asking Finder got an answer with no claims checked, which is the one
thing the product exists to do. The demo's whole job is to show the product,
and it was showing a different one.

So the answer itself lives here, once. Everything from "the context is
ready" to "every claim is scored" runs through this module for both
surfaces: the same model routing, the same streamed gist, the same verdict
box, the same claim extraction, verification, per-claim research,
blind second look and score. What stays with each caller is what genuinely
differs - who is asking, where the history comes from, and whether anything
is written down. The app persists every step; the demo persists nothing.

The shape is a run object rather than one function because the callers
interleave their own work between the phases - the app saves the draft and
announces it between writing and checking - and both need the same events
in the same order around that.
