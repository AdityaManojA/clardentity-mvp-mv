/* Service worker, present mainly so the app is installable.
 *
 * Chrome will not offer "install" without a service worker that handles
 * fetch, so this exists to satisfy that and to make a cold launch of the
 * installed app feel instant - not to make the app work offline. An AI
 * companion with no network is a text box that can't answer anything, and
 * caching answers would be actively wrong: every response here is scored
 * against sources that can change.
 *
 * So the strategy is deliberately narrow: cache the static build output,
 * never cache API traffic, and always go to the network for pages.

// Bumping this name is how a deploy drops everything the last one cached:
// `activate` deletes every cache that isn't this one.
//
// v4: the Co-Creative image card shipped and did not reach anyone who had
// the app open before it - the static chunks are served cache-first, so a
// browser holding v3 kept running a bundle with no card in it and the
// feature read as broken while the server was generating pictures
// perfectly well. Bump this whenever a shipped fix has to reach an existing
// tab, not just a new one.
//
// v5: the landing demo became the real chat UI, and the composer, the
// message list and two of the stores all changed to do it. Verifying any of
// that against a v4 cache measured the old bundle - twice in one sitting,
// which is the same hour lost as last time.
//
// v6: the greetings and the demo-to-account handoff. The handoff reads a
// transcript left in localStorage by a *previous* build of the landing
// page, so a browser running v5 chunks against a v6 deploy is exactly the
// case this has to survive.
//
// v7: the tracker batch - a Log in link in the landing nav, and the entry
// route now calling /bootstrap instead of three endpoints in a row. An old
// bundle would keep making the three calls against a backend that has the
// one, which works but is the slowness we just removed.
//
// v8: the end-to-end pass. "Skip for now" on the welcome questions was
// discarding answers already typed - a bundle still doing that would keep
// throwing away the one thing a new account tells us about itself.
//
// v9: smart switching in the demo and the new welcome copy. The demo's
// client now sends smart_switching and reads a "switched" event; an old
// bundle would send neither and show neither.
