/* Installable as a desktop and mobile app.

 * on and gives the installed copy its own window with no address bar - which
 * is the whole point: a companion you keep open beside your work shouldn't
 * look like a tab you'll close by accident.
 *
 * start_url is /workspace rather than /: signed-in users are who install
 * apps, and landing them on the marketing page every launch is a redirect
 * they'd have to sit through. Signed-out users get bounced to /login by
 * RequireAuth, which is where they were going anyway.
