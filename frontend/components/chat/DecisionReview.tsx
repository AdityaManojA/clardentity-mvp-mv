/* A verdict on each option the user brought.
 *
 * Distinct from the answer above it, which compares the options on their
 * merits. This asks a different question - is each one even a fair candidate -
 * and it is the half people don't think to ask for. Shown as a panel rather
 * than folded into the prose because it is a checklist against their own
 * words, and prose is the wrong shape for that.
 *
 * Rebuilt onto the app's own scale. It used to be 12px from its heading to
 * its smallest footnote, with the bias names set in uppercase amber, and it
 * sat directly above a 20px gist - so the analysis read as small print
 * attached to the answer rather than as the other half of it. There are three
 * steps now: the option you are being told about, why, and the footnote that
 * defines the bias. The bias name is a chip rather than a shout.
