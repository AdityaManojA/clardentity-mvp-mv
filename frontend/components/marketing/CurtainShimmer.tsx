/* The curtain catches the light - and the wind - where the cursor is.
 *
 * The effect is built out of the asset's own measurements. A column-
 * brightness profile of the band the design actually shows, autocorrelated,
 * has its strongest repeat at 1.709% of the image's width: that is one fold
 * to the next, about fifty pleats across the stage. The colour is the mean of
 * every lit-fabric pixel in the same band, #a72341, with #d74564 for the edge
 * of a fold turned toward the light. So the bands land on the real folds and
 * wear the curtain's own burgundy.
 *
 * Each pleat is its own element rather than one repeating-gradient mask,
 * because a gradient can only be slid as a whole and wind has to move each
 * fold by a different amount. They are flat colour, not copies of the
 * photograph: fifty cheap divs instead of fifty textures, and every pleat the
 * same shade - brightening a copy of the picture gave each one a different
 * one, depending on what happened to be behind it.
 *
 * Nothing here runs under prefers-reduced-motion.
