/* The composer on the stage, demonstrating itself.
 *
 * It used to type a rotating list of questions into a box while the eight
 * mode pills sat underneath, all identical and all inert. That showed what
 * you can ask but not the thing the product is actually about - that the
 * question picks the companion. A question about a tenancy agreement with
 * none of the eight lit is a search box with decoration under it.
 *
 * Now the mode and the question arrive together: a pill lights, its question
 * types itself out, both clear, and another mode takes over. One full pass
 * covers all eight, so anyone who watches long enough has seen the range.
 *
 * The order is shuffled rather than left to right. Left to right reads as a
 * list being recited, and whichever mode happened to be eighth would almost
 * never be seen - a visitor watches three or four of these, not a minute of
 * them.
