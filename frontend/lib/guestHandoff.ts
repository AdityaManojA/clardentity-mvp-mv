 * is offered an account to keep what they wrote, the transcript has to
 * travel with them, through the one place it exists: this browser.
 *
 * It waits in localStorage across the trip to /register and the welcome
 * questions, and is posted to /guest/import the first time the app loads
 * signed in. Then it is deleted, whether or not the import worked, with one
 * exception - a request that failed for a reason that might pass on a retry
 * keeps it for the next page load, because the alternative is losing the
 * thing we promised to keep.
