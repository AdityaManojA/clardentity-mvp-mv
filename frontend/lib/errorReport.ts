 * "Send report" is that consent for this one event, and nothing else - the
 * SDK is loaded with in-memory persistence (no cookie, no stored id) if it
 * wasn't already running, and nothing is tracked after it.
 *
 * What goes: the reference shown to the person, which part of the app
 * failed, the error's type, the first frame of its stack, and the route
 * pattern (never the URL - a chat URL carries its conversation id). What
 * never goes: the error message, which can quote whatever was on screen. */
