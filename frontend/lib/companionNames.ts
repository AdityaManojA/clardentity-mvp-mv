/* What the user calls their companion in each mode.
 *
 * Two unrelated components need this - the mode switcher and the mode-nudge
 * card - and neither owns the profile. A module-level store means one fetch
 * per session rather than one per component, and it is read through
 * useSyncExternalStore so a rename updates every consumer at once without a
 * context provider threaded through the shell.
 *
 * An unnamed mode is the normal case: it renders as the mode's own label, so
 * the fallback is never an empty string or a placeholder.
