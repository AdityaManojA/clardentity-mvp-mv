/* Product analytics: which companions get used, and where people give up.
 *
 * Two rules decide everything about the shape of this file.
 *
 * The first is that this product's promise is that you can see what an
 * answer rests on. An app like that cannot ship a tracker that quietly
 * ships the questions people ask. So nothing here ever carries content:
 * no question text, no answer text, no file names, no email addresses,
 * no titles. Events carry a name and a handful of enumerated properties -
 * a mode, a count, a duration bucket - and are checked against that rule
 * where they are sent, not only where they are written (see `track`).
 *
 * The second is that it must be switchable off and invisible when it is.
 * With no key configured every function here is a no-op that costs one
 * comparison, the SDK is never downloaded, and no cookie is written -
 * which is also what makes the build safe to run in CI and in a local dev
 * loop without polluting the numbers.
